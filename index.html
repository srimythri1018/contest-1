    <h1>DRONE</h1>
    <p>An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without any human pilot, crew, or passengers on board.
     UAVs were originally developed through the twentieth century for military missions too "dull, dirty or dangerous" for humans, 
     and by the twenty-first, they had become essential assets to most militaries. As control technologies improved and costs fell,
      their use expanded to many non-military applications.These include aerial photography, precision agriculture, forest fire monitoring,river monitoring,
      environmental monitoring,policing and surveillance, infrastructure inspections, smuggling,product deliveries, entertainment, and 
      drone racing.</p>
